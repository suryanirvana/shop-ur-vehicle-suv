## Description:
shopurvehicle(SUV) app is an application that is focused on vehicle rents and tourist destinations. In this application,
the users will be able to add their cars for rent, search, and view a list of cars that can be rented out. To ease the users
of searching the cars, we divide the cars into categories. All the users who have already rented a particular car will be able to
make a review and rating for that car and display it on the car description page. In addition, it can also be an evaluation for 
the renters in renting out their car to detect any deficiencies or flaws in their service. we will also provide a page of articles 
about tourist destinations in order to recommend users to rent a car to go to the destination.
